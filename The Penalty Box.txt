The Penalty Box
A Poem, by Jeremiah Fowler
6.22.2021

---

The penalty box
Isn't a box
To contemplate your actions,

Instead it's a place
To wipe off your face
And plan what you'll do next.

They'll open the door,
Your skates hit the floor,
And you go flying up the ice,

You call for your teammate,
He puts the puck onto your tape,
And you bury the puck in the back of the net.
